# UBC-SFU Joint Statistics Seminar

The UBC-SFU Joint Statistics Seminar is now in its 17th year (as of 2021). The event is organized twice per year by students from UBC and SFU. The purpose of the seminar is to give graduate students an opportunity to share their research projects with one another. At the end of the seminar, a faculty member gives a talk and the group typically goes to a local restaurant or orders food.

The Fall (September to December) semester's seminar is hosted by SFU while the Spring (January to April) semester seminar is hosted by UBC.
