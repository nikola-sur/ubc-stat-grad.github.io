# Graduate student seminars: by graduate students for graduate students

While the department has [its own seminar series](https://www.stat.ubc.ca/events-calendar),
the graduate students at UBC statistics also run their own seminars, which
have a much more relaxed and informal tone.

These seminars provide an ideal opportunity for current graduate students to
practice research presentations in a friendly environment.
We also frequently invite alumni that are working in the industry to
share their job-hunting and post-academic experience.

The seminars will be in-person again for the 2021&ndash;2022 academic year,
but they will also be broadcast through Zoom.
As before, the presenter will prepare a trivia question
to be made during their presentation.
Attendees who send the answer to the seminar organizers via email are in
for a food voucher giveaway.

In previous years, the department provided free pizza (yeah, you read that right!)
to graduate students who attended the seminars.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, the seminars were online but the food tradition stuck
and the organizers gave away online food vouchers.
