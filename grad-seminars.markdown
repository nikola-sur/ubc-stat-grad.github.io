# Graduate student seminars: by grad students for grad students

While the department has [its own seminar series](https://www.stat.ubc.ca/events-calendar),
the grad students at UBC statistics also run their own seminars, which
have a much more relaxed and informal tone.

These seminars provide an ideal opportunity for current grad students to
practice research presentations in a friendly environment.
We also frequently invite alumni that are working in the industry to
share their job-hunting and post-academic experience.

In previous years, the department provided free pizza (yeah, you read that right!)
to grad students who attended the seminars.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, the seminars were online but the food tradition stuck
and the organizers gave away online food vouchers.
