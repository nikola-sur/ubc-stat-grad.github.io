# Department duties

In previous years, department duties
(e.g., ensuring the lounge is clean at the end of the day)
were assigned to and rotated among graduate students on a weekly basis.
As graduate students are not required to be on campus during the COVID-19 pandemic,
 no duties are assigned this year.

Duties will be posted here when they return.

# Graduate student positions

Various positions and activities in the department are filled and organized by
graduate student volunteers (see the list below).
An open recruitment for these positions is usually done at the beginning of the academic year.
If a position that you're interested in is still open for the academic year,
contact the Graduate Student Representative to see how you can get involved!
