# Statistical consulting

Statistics grad students have the opportunity to work as consultants through services offered by the department. Information about these services can be found below. These opportunities are paid and are a great way to gain consulting experience on real cases as a statistics grad student. Consulting positions for these services are available to grad students who have completed STAT 550. If you are interested in working for any of these services, please contact the Grad Student Representative.


## STSC

The [Short Term Consulting Service](https://www.stat.ubc.ca/~stcs/) is run by grad students in the department and offers statistical assistance for short-term projects (typically less than 15 hours).


## ASDa

The [Applied Statistics and Data Science](https://asda.stat.ubc.ca/) (ASDa) group employs grad students in the department for their statistical consulting services, such as [SOS](https://asda.stat.ubc.ca/sos/) (which provides assistance to UBC graduate students) and MSA (which provides assistance to UBC medicine students).
