# Reading groups

Multiple professors within the department organize reading groups
for current and incoming graduate students.
In these, the discussion leader chooses a paper related to the theme
of the reading group and then presents it&mdash;although the idea is to
have a discussion between participants, rather than a presentation.

This is a (non-exhaustive) list of reading groups happening in the department.
Reach out to the contact person if you wish to join.


## Animal movement and distribution reading group
PI: [Dr. Marie Auger-Méthé](https://www.stat.ubc.ca/users/marie-auger-methe)
and [Dr. Nancy Heckman](https://www.stat.ubc.ca/users/nancy-e-heckman) \
Contact: [Evan Sidrow](https://www.stat.ubc.ca/users/evan-sidrow)

The Animal Movement and Distribution Reading Group is a group of graduate students,
faculty and postdoctoral fellows in the Statistics Department and the
Institute for the Oceans and Fisheries that meet every two weeks to discuss papers
that use animal movement and distribution data to answer important questions in ecology.
Typically, data are from tracking devices attached to animals.
Methods of analysis include hidden Markov models, state space models and
continuous time stochastic processes.
At each meeting, a group member leads discussion on a paper,
with discussions benefiting from the mix of backgrounds of group members.


## Scalable Bayesian statistics and machine learning reading group
PI: [Dr. Trevor Campbell](https://www.stat.ubc.ca/users/trevor-campbell) \
Contact: [Gian Carlo Diluvi](https://www.stat.ubc.ca/users/gian-carlo-di-luvi)

This group comprises graduate students, postdocs, and faculty in Statistics
and Computer Science who are interested in Bayesian computational methods.
Each week, we hold a 1-hour discussion which is led by a rotating presenter.
The presenter can choose the format, although whiteboard is preferred.
The goal is for the reading group to be a low pressure and informal environment
for all of us to learn.  This last year we have been doing a review of
 recent (2019&ndash;2021) work on variational methods.


## Symmetry, invariance, probability and machine learning reading group
PI: [Dr. Benjamin Bloem-Reddy](https://www.stat.ubc.ca/users/ben-bloem-reddy) \
Contact: [Johnny Xi](https://www.stat.ubc.ca/users/quanhan-johnny-xi)

The Symmetry, Invariance, Probability and Machine Learning (SIP-ML) reading
group consist of Statistics and Computer Science graduate students, postdocs
and faculty who meet every week to discuss a paper in the statistics and machine
learning literature. Group members rotate weekly as the discussion leader, whose
role is to casually present the paper and promote discussion. Topics of interest
in previous terms were diverse and ranged from empirical Bayes to normalizing flows,
including a summer's worth of Le Cam theory. For this term, the group meets
Thursdays at 4pm, and the key topics include invariant representation learning,
causal invariance, domain adaptation and robustness to distributional shifts.
