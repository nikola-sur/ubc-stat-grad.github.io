# Reading groups

Multiple professors within the department organize reading groups.
In these, the discussion leader chooses a paper related to the theme
of the reading group and then presents it&mdash;although the idea is to
have a discussion between participants, rather than a presentation.

This is a (non-exhaustive) list of reading groups happening in the department.
Reach out to the contact person if you wish to join.

## Animal movement and distribution reading group

The Animal Movement and Distribution Reading Group is a group of graduate students,
faculty and postdoctoral fellows in the Statistics Department and the
Institute for the Oceans and Fisheries that meet every two weeks to discuss papers
that use animal movement and distribution data to answer important questions in ecology.
Typically, data are from tracking devices attached to animals.
Methods of analysis include hidden Markov models, state space models and
continuous time stochastic processes.
At each meeting, a group member leads discussion on a paper,
with discussions benefiting from the mix of backgrounds of group members.
