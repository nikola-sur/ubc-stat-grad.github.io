# Social hangouts

We like to meet to have a beer or coffee and chat.
Usually, we do this at [Koerner's pub](https://www.koerners.ca/),
which is on-campus, but sometimes we also meet in other places in Vancouver.

If you want to organize an event, shoot an email to the website administrator
(see [about webpage](./about.html)) to add it to the calendar. And invite your friends!
