# Social hangouts

We meet frequently to chat and have a beer or coffee.
Usually, we do this at [Koerner's pub](https://www.koerners.ca/),
which is on-campus, but sometimes we also meet in other places in Vancouver.
We also have the *#social* channel on the UBC Statistics Slack for more sporadic
events&mdash;don't forget to join!

If you want to organize an event, shoot an email to the [Webmaster](./about.html)
to add it to the calendar. Make sure to invite your friends!
