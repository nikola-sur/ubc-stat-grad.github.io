# Dr. Constance van Eeden seminar

The van Eeden seminar is a yearly event in which graduate students
vote for their favorite statisticians.
The winner of the votes is contacted by the organizing committee and invited
to do a presentation.
Before COVID-19, the speaker spent one or two days on-campus,
and graduate students had the opportunity to have lunch and dinner with them.

The van Eeden seminar is supported by the Constance van Eeden fund,
which was established by Dr. van Eeden in 1998.
