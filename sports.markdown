# Departmental sports teams

There are several sports teams within the department.
Note that most of these are on hold due to the COVID-19 pandemic,
but stay tuned for when they come back!

## Cycling

We always partake in [HUB Cycling](https://bikehub.ca/)'s
[Go by Bike Week](https://bikehub.ca/bike-events/go-by-bike-week),
which in Fall 2021 is taking place from Sept. 27 to Oct. 3.

Join our team and log your kilometers!
Contact [Mair√©ad](https://www.stat.ubc.ca/users/mairead-roche) for more information.


## Soccer

The *Mean Squared Terrors* is the department's soccer team,
competing in [UBC intramurals'](https://recreation.ubc.ca/intramurals/)
futsal tournament in term 2.

If you want to join the team, reach out to
[Jonathan](https://www.stat.ubc.ca/users/jonathan-ok-agyeman).
The matches usually take place during the weekends or weekday evenings,
and we play against other teams within UBC.

[Lang](https://www.stat.ubc.ca/users/lang-wu) for more information.


## Organize something!

Is your favourite sport not on the list above?
Consider organizing your own sports team within the department!
