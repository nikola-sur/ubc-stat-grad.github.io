# Departmental sports teams

There are several sports teams within the department.
Note that most of these are on hold due to the COVID-19 pandemic,
but stay tuned for when they come back!


## Soccer

The *Mean Squared Terrors* is the department's soccer team,
competing in [UBC intramurals'](https://recreation.ubc.ca/intramurals/)
futsal tournament in term 2.

If you want to join the team, reach out to
[Jonathan](https://www.stat.ubc.ca/users/jonathan-ok-agyeman).
The matches usually take place during the weekends or weekday evenings,
and we play against other teams within UBC.

## Table tennis

We also have table tennis matches during the afternoons.
These usually happen in room ESB 4192, but shoot an email to
[Lang](https://www.stat.ubc.ca/users/lang-wu) for more information.


## Organize something!

Is your favourite sport not on the list above?
Consider organizing your own sports team within the department!
Feel free to contact one of the [graduate student executives](./about.html) if you would like to receive help promoting your new sports team.
