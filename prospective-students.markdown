# Prospective students

From current UBC graduate students to future UBC graduate students.


## About the department

The Department of Statistics at UBC was founded in 1984. More information about the UBC Statistics department can be found on the [departmental homepage](https://www.stat.ubc.ca/).

<!--
## Funding

As per [UBC's guidelines](https://www.grad.ubc.ca/awards/minimum-funding-policy-phd-students),
all graduate students are offered at least $22,000CAD per year.
These come from a combination of scholarships, TAships, and RAships.
What this means is that the funding might be contingent on you
working as a TA, for example, but that the department guarantees
PhD students in the department are also offered tuition waivers.
